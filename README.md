# GLSL to Unity Shader Converter
When complete this will handle most of the repetitive aspects of converting a GLSL shader to A Unity Ready Shader. I'm still learning Shaders, so this is a WORK IN PROGRESS

USAGE:
Copy GLSL into Left Hand Pane, Hit F5 on the keyboard to convert (It will be on the right hand pane) AND will also copy the converted shader to the clipboard. 

AUTHOR NOTE:
My experience thus far is limited with shaders so I'll update this as I work with more complex shaders, and it's not perfect and absolutely requires tweaking once the conversion occurs. This does a good deal of the basic work I was finding myself repeating (Subshader wrapping, replacing floats, etc)
